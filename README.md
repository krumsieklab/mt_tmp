# Maplet: Metabolomics Analysis PipeLinE Toolbox

Maplet is an R package for statistical data analysis with a special focus on metabolomics datasets. It allows users to create self-contained analytical pipelines. The toolbox builds upon the bioconductor package SummarizedExperiment (SE), which serves as a central repository for each pipeline’s data, analysis steps, and results. Maplet provides a suite of functions for interacting with this container including but not limited to data loading, annotation, statistical analysis, visualization, and reporting. Maplet is designed to work with the pipe operator (%>%) from the magrittr package. This operator allows for smooth connections between pipeline steps, without the need for temporary variables or multiple assignments. The combination of these three elements allows for the creation of pipelines which are simple to follow, highly modular, and easily reproducible.
