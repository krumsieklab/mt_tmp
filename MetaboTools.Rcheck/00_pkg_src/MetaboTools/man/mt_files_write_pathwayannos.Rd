\title{Write out all pathway annotations, possible redundant pathways, and metabolite annotations.}
\usage{
mt_files_write_pathwayannos(D, pwfield, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{\code{SummarizedExperiment} input}

\item{pwfield}{name of the pathway annotation field}

\item{file}{output filename to write to}
}
\value{
Does not change the SummarizedExperiment.
}
\description{
Creates an Excel file that contains detailed metabolite-to-pathway mapping information. Writes out 4 different forms of the mapping information.
Also includes information about which pathways are redundant, i.e. contain the same set of metabolites.
