\title{Comparative plot between two comparisons.}
\usage{
mt_plots_compare2stats(
  D1,
  stat1,
  filter1,
  D2 = D1,
  stat2,
  filter2,
  filterop = "AND",
  plot_title = "",
  label_column = "name",
  point_size = 1.5,
  return.plot.only = F,
  export.file = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{D1}{first SE dataset to compare; the one in the pipeline}

\item{stat1}{name of statistical comparison in first dataset}

\item{filter1}{filter term, defining which metabolites to label from first comparison (can use elements of stats table)}

\item{D2}{second SE dataset, if not given, will be the same as the first}

\item{stat2}{name of statistical comparison in second dataset}

\item{filter2}{filter term, defining which metabolites to label from second comparison (can use elements of stats table)}

\item{filterop}{if AND -> two colors, one for those where both stats match the criterion, and one where they don't
if OR -> three colors, a third one where only one stat matches the criterion}

\item{plot_title}{optional param for plot title}

\item{label_column}{optional argument on which column in the statistical results df to use for labeling points}

\item{point_size}{size of the points on the ggplot}

\item{return.plot.only}{return only the plot object. WARNING: setting this to true makes the function non-MT pipeline compatible.}
}
\value{
$result: plot, p-value histogram
}
\description{
Produces a plot that compares the directed -log10 p-values between two previously executed stats.
