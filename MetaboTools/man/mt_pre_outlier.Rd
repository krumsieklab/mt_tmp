\title{Identifies sample outliers.}
\usage{
mt_pre_outlier(D, method = "univariate", reduce_dim = F, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{D}{\code{SummarizedExperiment} input}

\item{method}{Can be either "univariate" or "leverage" (for now)}

\item{reduce_dim}{Perform PCA-based dimension reduction before outlier detection? Needed for multivariate methods in low-rank datasets.}

\item{thresh}{Number of standard deviations or m/n units to use as threshold to define the outlier, default value set to 4}

\item{perc}{For the univariate method, percentage of metabolites that need to be outliers in order to consider the whole sample an outlier, default value set to 0.5}

\item{pval}{For the mahalanobis distance method, p-val of chi-squared test to threshold at, default = 0.01}
}
\value{
SE with additional colData columns including a binary vector and a numeric score vector

$output: returns the specific parameters used to determine outliers for the specific method selected
}
\description{
Uses either univariate or multivariate (leverage) approaches, won't do both in one call.
